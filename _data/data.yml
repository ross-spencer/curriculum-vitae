experiences:
    - role: Software Developer
      time: 2017 - Present
      company: Artefactual Systems Inc., Canada
      details: |
        Working on the Archivematica and Access to Memory projects. My role is
        to analyze digital preservation workflow requirements and find software
        based solutions to satisfy those. Analysis may be done on client
        requirements or on those set-out by the analyst teams at Artefactual.
        Archivematica is developed in Python but solutions may not always
        require the use of code, nor be focused on the system itself.

        I have been involved in the Access to Memory (AtoM) project in the
        migration of legacy archival records to formats compatible with the
        system.

        I have delivered technical training at three Archivematica Camps, in
        South Africa and the United States and participated in an Archivematica
        camp in the Netherlands. I have also developed training materials on an
        ad-hoc basis depending on a client's needs.

          - Analysis, design, and delivery of client solutions.
          - Maintenance and documentation of new and legacy code and systems.
          - Delivering Archivematica training.

    - role: Digital Preservation Analyst
      time: 2013 - 2017
      company: Archives New Zealand, New Zealand
      details: |
        Digital Preservation Analyst at Archives New Zealand whose primary role
        was to support the System, Strategy, Standards team (SSS) formerly
        Digital Continuity; in making preservation decisions and providing
        digital preservation guidance. Having worked with colleagues to help
        enable Archive New Zealand's first born-digital transfers.

        The organization required us to work closely with digital preservation
        colleagues at National Library New Zealand and the Alexander Turnbull
        Library to develop joint-digital preservation strategy and policy.

        Our mandate also enabled us to perform digital preservation outreach
        tasks across the New Zealand government sector.

        I maintained strong personal links with the wider digital preservation
        community. It is hoped our benefit from the community's effort was
        somewhat equal to what I hope we were able to contribute.

        I was a member of the Archives New Zealand Waiata group, Nga Manu Iere
        which helped me to foster a more personal and cultural understanding of
        New Zealand and its traditions.

          - Policy development across New Zealand's government sector.
          - Development of digital preservation workflows.)
          - Collaboration with teams to resolve complex technical issues.
          - Outreach within the New Zealand digital preservation community.

    - role: Digital Preservation Researcher
      time: 2009 - 2012
      company: The National Archives, United Kingdom
      details: |
        The research and provision of solutions to the end of preserving
        government's digital records.

        Part of my focus was researching file format specifications and
        developing mechanisms to identify those file formats using regular
        expression patterns unique to The National Archives' PRONOM database.
        My role was also centered on the development of policy to be followed
        internally, and by contractors employed on projects such as those for
        digitization.

        I was able to make connections with the wider digital preservation
        community while in my role at The National Archives where we were
        invited to participate in projects such as the Unified Digital File
        Formats Registry (UDFR); or working groups such as that for the
        development of JPEG2000 policy and procedures at the Wellcome
        Trust in the UK.

        I was able to continue programming for The National Archives, UK,
        developing solutions for them in Python, PHP, and C++. Though much of
        it was completed in my spare time to then convert into work
        assignments, for example, the
        [PRONOM signature development utility](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom/sigdev/index.htm).

          - PRONOM and DROID signature development.
          - Requirements analysis and community outreach.
          - File format Analysis.
          - Development of procedure and standards for born-digital transfer.

    - role: Junior Analyst Programmer
      time: 2007 - 2009
      company: Red Box Recorders, United Kingdom
      details: |
        Junior Analyst Programmer developing VOIP (Voice over IP) recording
        solutions; written primarily in C++. Areas of focus included improving
        existing solutions for recording Avaya, Nortel, Cisco, Ericsson and SIP
        VOIP calls, and implementing new solutions for VOIP providers such as
        Panasonic. Some other important protocols I focused on included, H225,
        Q931, and MGCP. I was also involved in back end development for our web
        front-end maintaining an ISAPI DLL. Front-end development required
        JavaScript and XHTML skills to add functionality to a HTML-form based
        interface. I introduced the use of AJAX to the recorder front-end.

        At Red Box I saw through a number of important projects including the
        implementation of a number of new features such as the development of a
        search filtering mechanism; and a Cisco-based recording as a service
        solution. I developed fixes for many different areas of the system as
        part of additional third-line support duties.

        Through my work at Red Box Recorders I refined my problem solving
        abilities and developed a better grasp for team work and meeting
        project deadlines. The contribution of this role to my knowledge of
        digital forensics, reverse engineering, and understanding of the IP
        stack and technical specifications remains immeasurable in the roles I
        have pursued in my current domain.

          - Reverse engineering.
          - Analysis of specifications.
          - Protocol level development.
