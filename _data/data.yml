    - role: Implementing AtoM in the Pacific (contract)
      time: July 2021 - December 2021
      company: PARBICA; Digipres Collective
      details: |
        Consultancy role with the Digipres Collective for PARBICA (Pacific
        Bureau of the International Council on Archives (ICA)). Developing
        guidance for implementing Access to Memory (AtoM) in the Pacific. The
        project developed a PARBICA toolkit module that elaborated on how to run
        a shared cloud-instance of AtoM in the Pacific. In collaboration with
        colleagues in the Digipres Collective, the module is aimed at helping
        PARBICA and its member institutions to answer critical questions around
        governance, administration, data-backup, and other technical aspects,
        that should help assure organizations that they will have access to an
        instance of AtoM that is most suited to their needs. We prepared for the
        toolkit modules by running a pilot project with a number of Pacific
        institutions, providing training, and toolkit walk-throughs by way of
        creating guidance interactively and learning from those intended to use
        the modules as we went. The initial work-effort involved running a
        survey to understand readiness and the potential scope of a pilot. A
        user-guide was published by PARBICA that was modified by the Digipres
        Collective from guidance originally developed by the Association for
        Manitoba Archives (AMA). It is hoped this guidance will be further built
        upon by similar projects in the future. Evaluation and lessons-learned
        documents were provided to the PARBICA team after the wrap-up of the
        project.

    - role: Software Developer (contract (pro-bono))
      time: 2020 - 2021
      company: Independent collaboration with Yale University Library
      details: |
        A 350+ hour development project in collaboration with Yale University
        Library and Siegfried's maintainer to integrate Wikidata sources into
        the format identification tool. The project involved establishing and
        maintaining a regular cadence of effort over the course of
        approximately seven months in my spare time. My time was contributed
        on a pro-bono basis and I organized and tracked that effort as I would
        contracting. Development required the analysis and cleaning of the data
        in Wikidata; coralling the data into a format suitable for Siegfried;
        and the Siegfried backend development required to handle the new
        extension. We are still working on establishing the type of ecosystem
        required to introduce the digital preservation community into that of
        Wikidata's.

        More information about the Wikidata identifier can be found on the
        Siegfried Wiki.

          - [Wikidata Identifier Guide](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/wiki/Wikidata-identifier).

        Key tasks of the role:

          - Understanding the Siegfried code-base and learning how to integrate
          a new data source.
          - Analysis and cleaning of the Wikidata sources and understanding how
          to make it a coherent source of information for Siegfried.
          - Regular collaboration and sharing of ideas with the Yale team and
          Richard Lehane.
          - Development of the identifier to deliver the first iteration in
          September 2020.

    - role: Software Developer
      time: 2017 - 2021
      company: Artefactual Systems Inc., Canada
      details: |
        Working on the Archivematica and Access to Memory projects. The role
        asked me to analyze digital preservation workflow requirements and find
        software based solutions to satisfy those. Analysis may be done on
        client requirements or on those set-out by the analyst teams at
        Artefactual.

        Archivematica is developed in Python but solutions may not always
        require the use of code, nor be focused on the system itself.

        I was involved in the Access to Memory (AtoM) project in the migration
        of legacy archival records to formats compatible with the system.

        I have delivered technical training at three Archivematica Camps, in
        South Africa and the United States and participated in an Archivematica
        camp in the Netherlands. I have also developed training materials on an
        ad-hoc basis depending on a client's needs. The most recent training I
        developed was for a client in Winnipeg in the province of Manitoba,
        Canada.

        The experience with Archivematica and its clients has given me broad
        experience of the challenges facing those in memory institutions. It
        gave me an opportunity to learn more about systems like Dataverse, and
        asked me to consider many different approaches to the work we're doing
        in the GLAM sector.

        Some of my more interesting projects at Artefactual gave me the
        opportunity to consider novel solutions to challenges like
        de-duplication, digital preservation reporting, and repository
        maintenance.

        Key tasks of the role:

          - Develop, integrate, and test software for Artefactual clients or
          internal projects, in alignment with the goals and standards of the
          open source projects and the company.
          - Create designs, proposals, and estimates for client or internal
          solutions, new software or changes to existing systems; clearly
          communicate how designs meet user, non-functional or architectural
          goals and requirements.
          - Create developer focused training collateral and deliver training
          in remote workshops or client site visits.
          - Work collaboratively with other members of the Project Delivery
          Team, and with other business units across the company.
          - Provide public outreach and community support relating to
          Archivematica or AtoM as open-source projects, including
          participation in conferences and software camps.

    - role: Digital Preservation Analyst
      time: 2013 - 2017
      company: Archives New Zealand, New Zealand
      details: |
        Digital Preservation Analyst at Archives New Zealand whose primary role
        was to support the System, Strategy, Standards team (SSS) formerly
        Digital Continuity; in making preservation decisions and providing
        digital preservation guidance. Having worked with colleagues to help
        enable Archive New Zealand's first born-digital transfers.

        The organization required us to work closely with digital preservation
        colleagues at National Library New Zealand and the Alexander Turnbull
        Library to develop joint-digital preservation strategy and policy.

        Our mandate also enabled us to perform digital preservation outreach
        tasks across the New Zealand government sector.

        I maintained strong personal links with the wider digital preservation
        community. It is hoped our benefit from the community's effort was
        somewhat equal to what I hope we were able to contribute.

        I was a member of the Archives New Zealand Waiata group, Nga Manu Iere
        which helped me to foster a more personal and cultural understanding of
        New Zealand and its traditions.

        Key tasks of the role:

          - Policy development across New Zealand's government sector.
          - Development of digital preservation workflows.)
          - Collaboration with teams to resolve complex technical issues.
          - Outreach within the New Zealand digital preservation community.

    - role: Digital Preservation Researcher
      time: 2009 - 2012
      company: The National Archives, United Kingdom
      details: |
        The research and provision of solutions to the end of preserving
        government's digital records.

        Part of my focus was researching file format specifications and
        developing mechanisms to identify those file formats using regular
        expression patterns unique to The National Archives' PRONOM database.
        My role was also centered on the development of policy to be followed
        internally, and by contractors employed on projects such as those for
        digitization.

        I was able to make connections with the wider digital preservation
        community while in my role at The National Archives where we were
        invited to participate in projects such as the Unified Digital File
        Formats Registry (UDFR); or working groups such as that for the
        development of JPEG2000 policy and procedures at the Wellcome
        Trust in the UK.

        I was able to continue programming for The National Archives, UK,
        developing solutions for them in Python, PHP, and C++. Though much of
        it was completed in my spare time to then convert into work
        assignments, for example, the
        [PRONOM signature development utility](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom/sigdev/index.htm),
        now also [ffdev.info](https://ffdev.info).

        Key tasks of the role:

          - PRONOM and DROID signature development.
          - Requirements analysis and community outreach.
          - File format Analysis.
          - Development of procedure and standards for born-digital transfer.

    - role: Junior Analyst Programmer
      time: 2007 - 2009
      company: Red Box Recorders, United Kingdom
      details: |
        Junior Analyst Programmer developing VOIP (Voice over IP) recording
        solutions; written primarily in C++. Areas of focus included improving
        existing solutions for recording Avaya, Nortel, Cisco, Ericsson and SIP
        VOIP calls, and implementing new solutions for VOIP providers such as
        Panasonic. Some other important protocols I focused on included, H225,
        Q931, and MGCP. I was also involved in back end development for our web
        front-end maintaining an ISAPI DLL. Front-end development required
        JavaScript and XHTML skills to add functionality to a HTML-form based
        interface. I introduced the use of AJAX to the recorder front-end.

        At Red Box I saw through a number of important projects including the
        implementation of a number of new features such as the development of a
        search filtering mechanism; and a Cisco-based recording as a service
        solution. I developed fixes for many different areas of the system as
        part of additional third-line support duties.

        Through my work at Red Box Recorders I refined my problem solving
        abilities and developed a better grasp for team work and meeting
        project deadlines. The contribution of this role to my knowledge of
        digital forensics, reverse engineering, and understanding of the IP
        stack and technical specifications remains immeasurable in the roles I
        have pursued in my current domain.

        Key tasks of the role:

          - Reverse engineering.
          - Analysis of specifications.
          - Protocol level development of software.
